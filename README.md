yeah lets get it bois

## TODO EOD 5/1
- refactor all "users" to "client"
- get working send and receive messages (no commands)
- [stretch] send and receive messages w/ commands

## Flow:
- run server, network and client py files all in different terminal windows
- login for client, server waits for login command and handles it
- client asks user to send commands (-h should show help)
